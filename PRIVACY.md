# Privacy Policy for sleek

This document outlines the information collected by sleek and how it is used by its developer, prioritizing user privacy.

As the developer of sleek, I highly value privacy, especially considering the widespread and unnecessary collection of personal data nowadays. My intention is for sleek to stand apart by not gathering sensitive user information.

However, it is important for me to understand the number of active sleek users and, if a user explicitly agrees, how sleek is utilized. To achieve this, the app communicates with a Matomo instance that I host myself. All data is transmitted securely over SSL encryption. sleek follows standard logging procedures. The information collected by Matomo includes only masked internet protocol (IP) addresses, operating systems, screen resolutions, date and time stamps, as well as basic app settings. Additionally, a non-personalized random user ID is generated. This allows me to track the number of unique sleek users without compromising sensitive data.

## Default Logging
Upon launching sleek, it notifies the Matomo instance that it has been started. This occurs once per app session and serves the purpose of providing me with an estimate of the user base and their approximate locations. With this information, I can make decisions such as which language to prioritize for future updates.

## Error Logging
Error logging is not enabled by default. You must explicitly activate it in sleek's settings. As I develop sleek, I rely on error response messages to understand its functionality. However, the errors I encounter during development may differ from those experienced by other users. Once error logging is activated, all error information generated by users will be sent to the Matomo instance. This data assists me in maintaining and improving sleek.

## Event Logging
Event logging is not enabled by default. You must explicitly activate it in sleek's settings. Events typically encompass interactions such as button clicks, checkbox selections, and link clicks. This information is valuable as it helps me understand which features are utilized and which ones are not. These insights enable me to maintain a streamlined and user-friendly experience within sleek. Please note that event logging does not collect personal information such as the content of your todos or filters. It solely provides information on clicked elements.

## Cookies
sleek does not utilize cookies. Any data requiring persistence is written to a local file on your computer and is not transferred elsewhere.

By using sleek, you consent to this Privacy Policy.

If you have any additional questions or need further information regarding this Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to contact me.
