# Privacy Policy for sleek
This document contains types of information that is collected by sleek and how I as it's developer use it.

I myself am very sensible about my own privacy and in these days, where a massive and needless collection of personal data is evident in so many software products out there, I want sleek to be different. I am not interested in who sleek's users are and will therefor not gather any personal or sensitive data. Seriously, I couldn't care less who you are.

However I would like to know how many users are actively using sleek and, in case a user explicitly agrees to it, how sleek is being used. The app communicates with a privately hosted Matomo instance (www.robbfolio.de/matomo/) exclusively via a secure SSL-encrypted connection. sleek follows a standard procedure of logging. The information collected by Matomo include internet protocol (IP) addresses (two bytes are masked), operating system, screen resolution as well as date and time stamp. Also a non personalized user id is being generated using the users' system architecture and platform type as well as the users' hostname. This information is being hashed using MD5. Only like this I can measure how many unique sleek users are out there.

As you can hopefully see, none of this is linked to any information that is personally identifiable.

## Default logging
Once sleek is opened, it will announce to the Matomo instance that it is active. This happens one time per app session and has the purpose of telling me how many users are using sleek and where these users are roughly located. With this information I can for instance decide which language should be added next and so forth.

## Error logging
Error logging is not active per default. You need to activate it explicitly in sleek's settings. While developing sleek, I rely on error response messages, that tell me what is going on with sleek. The problem with this is, that I can only see errors I provoke myself using sleek for my own use cases. But these use cases will most likely differ from how other sleek users will utilize the app. So once the error logging is active, all error information users provoke will be sent to the Matomo instance. With this information I can maintain and improve sleek.

## Event logging
Event logging is not active per default. You need to activate it explicitly in sleek's settings. Events are mostly clicks on buttons, date pickers, checkboxes and so on. This information is really valuable to me, as it tells me which features are used and which ones are not. Those insights help me keeping sleek clean of unnecessary features that will interfere with sleeks usability. This type of logging will not collect any personal information like your todos, filters or whatsoever. It will only tell me which elements have been clicked.

By using sleek, you hereby consent to this Privacy Policy.

If you have additional questions or require more information about this Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me.
