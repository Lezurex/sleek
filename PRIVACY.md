# Privacy Policy for sleek
This document contains the types of information that is collected by sleek and how I as its developer use it.

I myself am very sensible about my own privacy and in these days of massive and needless collection of personal data, I want sleek to be different. I am not interested in who sleek's users are and will therefore not gather any sensitive data.

However, I want to know how many users are actively using sleek and, in case a user explicitly agrees to it, how sleek is being used. The app communicates with a Matomo instance I host myself. The data is exclusively sent via a secure SSL-encrypted connection. sleek follows a standard procedure of logging. The information collected by Matomo includes only masked internet protocol (IP) addresses, operating system, screen resolution, date and time stamp. Also, a non-personalized random user id is generated. This way, I can see how many unique sleek users are out there without collecting sensitive data.

The analysis can be disabled in the settings window.

## Event logging
Events are mostly clicks on buttons, checkboxes, links and so on. This information is valuable to me, as it tells me which features are used and which ones are not. Those insights help me keeping sleek clean of unnecessary features that will interfere with sleek's usability. This type of logging will not collect any personal information like the content of your todos or filters. It will only tell me which elements have been clicked.

## Cookies
sleek itself doesn't use cookies. Data that needs to be persisted is written to a local file that does not transfer anywhere else.

By using sleek, you hereby consent to this Privacy Policy.

If you have additional questions or require more information about this Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me.
