# sleek
## sleek is a todo app based on todo.txt, free and open-source. Available for Linux, Windows and MacOS
sleek is an open-source todo app that makes use of the todo.txt format. sleeks GUI is modern and clean yet offers a decent set of functions which help users getting things done. sleek is available as a client for Windows, MacOS and Linux.

By using sleeks GUI or simply writing in plain text todo.txt format, users can add contexts, projects, priorities, due dates or recurrences to their todos and use these todo.txt attributes as filters or search for them by full text search.

sleek watches todo.txt files continuously for changes so it can be used with other todo.txt apps. Users can switch between bright and dark mode, choose several languages and manage multiple todo.txt files.

The todo list can be sorted and grouped by priorities or due dates. Todos with due date or repeating todos will trigger alarms with thresholds of 1 or 2 days before the due date. Completed todos can be hidden or archived into separate done.txt files and if users have tons of todos, a compact view can come in handy.
